# Goal of the project:

This project has been produced to carry out the following assignment:

*The exam of statistical learning consists in two assignments, one on the first part(regression, tree, neural nets) and the second part (unsupervised learning). 
For both you must prepare a writing report using one or more techniques and comparing their performance on one or more data set chosen by the student.*

I decided to apply the statistical learning techniques on the Pima Indiands Diabetes dataset.

In this repository you can find:

* The report of the analysis in PDF. 
It is divided in two main sections, one about unsupervised methods (PCA, Clusternig) and the second one about supervised techniques (Logistic Regression, Tree Classifier, Ensemble Methods).
* The R code for the Unsupervised section.
* The R code for the Supervised section.
* The dataset.
